# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Learned and used Python to complete the analysis on the election data from the Colorado Board of Elections. The Board employees gave the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: PyCharm Community Edition 2021.1.3x64

  - Araphahoe with 6.7%. (24,801 votes)
-Denver had the largest number of votes and was the winning county.

The Election Analysis script would be great for future elections! The script provides useful information of the total votes and winner at the candidate and county level. Needed updates to the script would include:
-	Updated csv election data file; and 
-	Applicable header and/or row naming. Needed changes to the header and row script or variables is pertinent to receive an accurate count of the votes. 

Below are images of the script that could potentially need updating for future use.
